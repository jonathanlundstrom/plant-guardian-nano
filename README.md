# Plant Guardian

The project aims to create a simple watcher that keeps tabs on plant moisture and let's you check it in real time using your phone. It's based on an Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi and some analog soil moisture sensors. Of course, you could head out and buy some pre-made device for this, but it's more fun building it yourself. This is the Arduino code for the main application. For the Node.js code, please check [this repository](https://github.com/jonathanlundstrom/plant-guardian-node).

This was developed in partnership with [Conrad](https://www.conrad.se/) in their efforts to showcase makers around Sweden. I would therefore like to thank them for providing the hardware used in this project. Please also check out [their website](http://tekkie.se/) for more interesting projects.

### Usage
Clone the project and open up the Marlin project. Flash this to your Arduino Nano and you're good to go. The analog ports are A0 and A1 by default and the baudrate is set to 9600.
